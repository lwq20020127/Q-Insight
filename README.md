## üö© Updates

- 5.26 Released our Version 2 paper. We are ready to release all related resources and are only awaiting final approval from the company's open-source review process.

- 3.28 Released the Q-Insight Technical Report.

## üî• Introduction
We present the PLCC comparison between proposed Q-Insight and other IQA metrics on the left and list the applications of our Q-Insight on the right. Q-Insight shows significant performance on the out-of-domain datasets (e.g. CSIQ) compared to methods like DeQA, while simultaneously achieving score regression, degradation perception, and zero-shot image comparison reasoning tasks.
